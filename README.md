# Bedrock Addons
Official Bedrock Addons repository for the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mcres.octarus).

## What's the purpose?
The purpose of releasing the app as open-source is to provide a way for app developers to learn from my code and adapt it to their liking. 

## Is it limited to video games?
You don't have to just use it for Minecraft or video games, you can change anything you want, and no code is obfuscated so modify to your liking.
There are no limits on what you can do with this.

## How do I get started
[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and then [download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
Once you have done that, select the file location of where you saved Bedrock Addons locally, and open it in Android Studio. Wait for it to load the project resources, and then [set up an AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).
From there, click on "Build App" and it should install for the first time onto the device you set up. You are now ready to start experimenting with the code.
